    "\n",
    "In previous notebooks we showed that the distributed scheduler can be used to execute dask graphs, and so compute collections across multiple machines. However, the distributed scheduler also offers additional API that allow for finer control and asynchronous computation. In this notebook we delve into these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, the `distributed` scheduler implements a superset of of the standard library [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) API, allowing for asynchronous map-reduce like functionality. We can submit individual functions for evaluation with one set of inputs, or evaluated over a sequence of inputs with `submit()` and `map()`. Notice that the call returns immediately, giving one or more *futures*, whose status begins as \"pending\" and later becomes \"finished\". There is no blocking of the local python session.\n",
